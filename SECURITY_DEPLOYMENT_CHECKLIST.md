# CTea Security Deployment Checklist

## Critical Security Fixes Applied âœ…

### 1. Error Boundary Security
- [x] ProductionErrorBoundary no longer exposes technical details in production
- [x] Console logging wrapped with environment checks
- [x] Error details sanitized for production

### 2. Security Monitors
- [x] EnhancedSecurityMonitor completely hidden in production
- [x] SecurityHealthMonitor completely hidden in production
- [x] Debug flags required for development visibility

### 3. Logging Security
- [x] Console.log statements protected with environment checks
- [x] Console.error statements sanitized for production
- [x] Sensitive data patterns removed from logs

### 4. Content Validation
- [x] Enhanced XSS protection
- [x] SQL injection detection
- [x] Suspicious URL detection
- [x] Spam detection

### 5. Rate Limiting
- [x] Secure rate limiting with fallbacks
- [x] No sensitive data exposed in rate limit errors

## Pre-Deployment Checks

Before deploying to production:

1. Run the security audit:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/security-audit.sh
   ```

2. Test error boundaries:
   - Trigger an error in development to ensure details are shown
   - Deploy to staging and trigger an error to ensure details are hidden

3. Verify security monitors are hidden:
   - Check that no security debug panels are visible in production

4. Test logging:
   - Verify console.log statements are not visible in production
   - Verify error messages are sanitized

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment:

1. Check browser console for any exposed sensitive information
2. Verify error pages don't show technical details
3. Confirm security monitors are not visible
4. Test rate limiting functionality
5. Verify content validation is working

## Emergency Rollback

If security issues are discovered:

1. Immediately rollback to previous version
2. Check logs for any exposed sensitive data
3. Rotate any potentially compromised credentials
4. Investigate and fix issues in development
5. Re-deploy with fixes
