## Pre-Deployment Checks

Before deploying to production:

1. Run the quick security audit:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/security-audit-quick.sh
   ```

2. Test the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

3. Verify console behavior:
   - Check that console.log statements are not visible in production
   - Verify error messages are sanitized
   - Confirm development logging still works

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment:

1. Open browser console in production
2. Verify no sensitive information is exposed
3. Check that error pages don't show technical details
4. Confirm security monitors are not visible
5. Test error handling

## Emergency Rollback

If security issues are discovered:

1. Immediately rollback to previous version
2. Check logs for any exposed sensitive data
3. Rotate any potentially compromised credentials
4. Investigate and fix issues in development
5. Re-deploy with fixes
