          question: 'How do I start spilling tea?',
          answer: 'Simply visit our platform, click "Spill Tea," and share your crypto intel anonymously. You can choose to submit completely anonymously or connect your wallet for TEA token rewards. Our AI, CTeaBot, will add witty commentary to make your submission even spicier.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is it really anonymous?',
          answer: 'Yes! We use advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure submissions cannot be traced back to you. Even we can\'t identify anonymous submitters. Your privacy and safety are our top priorities.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What kind of content can I submit?',
          answer: 'We welcome crypto-related gossip, insider intel, market rumors, project drama, and industry tea. Content must be relevant to crypto/Web3 and follow our community guidelines. No doxxing, harassment, or illegal content.'

        },
        {
          question: 'How do I earn TEA tokens?',
          answer: 'Multiple ways: Submit quality tea (50-500 TEA), vote accurately on submissions (5-25 TEA), engage daily (10-50 TEA), refer friends (100 TEA), become a top weekly spiller (1,000 TEA), and moderate content (25-100 TEA).'
        },
        {
          question: 'Where can I buy TEA tokens?',

        {
          question: 'What can I do with TEA tokens?',

        {
          question: 'How does the voting system work?',
          answer: 'Community members vote on submissions using ðŸ”¥ (hot) or ðŸ§Š (cold) reactions. Hot submissions rise to the top and earn more rewards, while cold submissions get buried. Your voting accuracy affects your credibility score.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What is CTeaBot?',
          answer: 'CTeaBot is our AI commentary engine that adds witty, intelligent responses to every submission. Trained on crypto culture and blessed with unlimited sass, CTeaBot makes even dry intel entertaining and provides additional context.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How does the credibility system work?',
          answer: 'Your credibility score is based on submission quality, voting accuracy, community engagement, and TEA token stakes. Higher credibility users earn more rewards and have more influence in governance decisions.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I edit or delete my submissions?',
          answer: 'Anonymous submissions cannot be edited or deleted to maintain integrity. Wallet-connected submissions can be edited within 10 minutes of posting. This policy prevents manipulation while allowing quick fixes.'

          question: 'How do you protect my identity?',
          answer: 'We use zero-knowledge proofs, encrypted submissions, and decentralized storage. Anonymous submissions are completely untraceable, even by us. We never store IP addresses or identifying information for anonymous users.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What if someone tries to doxx me?',
          answer: 'Doxxing is strictly prohibited and results in immediate bans. We have automated detection systems and a rapid response team. If you feel threatened, contact our moderation team immediately through Discord or email.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do you prevent fake news?',
          answer: 'Community voting, AI analysis, credibility scoring, and human moderation work together to surface quality content. We don\'t claim to be a news source â€” we\'re a gossip platform where the community decides what\'s credible.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What data do you collect?',
          answer: 'For anonymous users: none. For wallet-connected users: wallet address, submission history, and engagement metrics. We never sell data and use minimal analytics. See our Privacy Policy for full details.'

        },
        {
          question: 'How do I report inappropriate content?',
          answer: 'Every submission has a report button. Our moderation team reviews reports within 24 hours. Repeated violations result in credibility penalties or bans. The community also helps moderate through voting.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I become a moderator?',
